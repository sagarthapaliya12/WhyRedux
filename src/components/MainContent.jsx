							It was hidden under the log beside the stream. It had been there
							for as long as Jerry had been alive. He wasn't sure if anyone
							besides him and his friends knew of its existence. He knew that
							anyone could potentially find it, but it was well enough hidden
							that it seemed unlikely to happen. The fact that it had been there
							for more than 30 years attested to this. So it was quite a
							surprise when he found the item was missing. MaryLou wore the
							tiara with pride. There was something that made doing anything she
							didn't really want to do a bit easier when she wore it. She really
							didn't care what those staring through the window were thinking as
							she vacuumed her apartment. "Are you getting my texts???" she
							texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath. Of
							course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how
							would he ever be able to answer? He put the phone down and
							continued on his project. He was ignoring her texts and he planned
							to continue to do so. After hunting for several hours, we finally
							saw a large seal sunning itself on a flat rock. I took one of the
							wooden clubs while Larry took the longer one. We slowly snuck up
							behind the seal until we were close enough to club it over its
							head. The seal slumped over and died. This seal would help us
							survive. We could eat the meat and fat. The fat could be burned in
							a shell for light and the fur could be used to make a blanket. We
							declared our first day of hunting a great success.

							It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain
							death had actually given him life. While everyone around him was
							in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said
							it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live,
							something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine
							that had passed as life until then. One foot in front of the
							other, One more step, and then one more. Jack's only thoughts were
							to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and
							rest. He's lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached
							beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then
							another. And then one more. The choice was red, green, or blue. It
							didn't seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it
							was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that
							time, he would likely have considered the choice a bit longer. In
							the end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue. They had always
							called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The
							river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in
							town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with
							great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent
							pink.

							There were about twenty people on the dam. Most of them were
							simply walking and getting exercise. There were a few who were
							fishing. There was a family who had laid down a blanket and they
							were having a picnic. It was like this most days and nothing
							seemed out of the ordinary. The problem was that nobody noticed
							the water leaking through the dam wall. Patricia's friend who was
							here hardly had any issues at all, but she wasn't telling the
							truth. Yesterday, before she left to go home, she heard that her
							husband is in the hospital and pretended to be surprised. It later
							came out that she was the person who had put him there. There was
							no ring on his finger. That was a good sign although far from
							proof that he was available. Still, it was much better than if he
							had been wearing a wedding ring on his hand. She glanced at his
							hand a bit more intently to see if there were any tan lines where
							a ring may have been, and he's simply taken it off. She couldn't
							detect any which was also a good sign and a relief. The next step
							would be to get access to his wallet to see if there were any
							family photos in it. He read about a hike called the incline in
							the guidebook. It said it was a strenuous hike and to bring plenty
							of water. “A beautiful hike to the clouds” described one review.
							“Not for the faint-hearted,” said another. “Not too bad of a
							workout”, bragged a third review. I thought I'd hike it when I fly
							in from Maryland on my day off from the senior citizen's wellness
							conference. I hiked 2 miles a day around the neighborhood so I
							could handle a 1.1-mile hike. What a foolish mistake that was for
							a 70-year-old low-lander.
